    "## Introduction \n",
    "Extreme heat is one of the deadliest climate hazards even though heat-related deaths are easily preventable. Disaster management and relief agencies need highly localized temperature information to target interventions, but often, the area of highest concerns lack local weather stations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Land-surface temperature can be remotely sensed at sub-kilometer scale, but isn't suitable for making health decisions. We aim to make use of this and other satellite data to estimate 2-meter air temperature on a sub-kilometer scale: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f \\left( T_{land}, \\epsilon, NDVI, p, h \\right) = T_{air}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "To do this analysis, we combine satellite data extracted at locations with air temperature observations into a Pandas data frame. Using Google Earth Engine's Python API, we read in satellite data for elevation $h$, emissivity $\\epsilon$,land cover percent impervious $p$, and raw Landsat8 data. We use this latter data to calculate land surface temperature $T_{land}$, vegetation fraction $NDVI$. Time-series of these data is sampled at weather station locations, and appended to a Pandas dataframe. These functions and sample code are documented here. Some additional javascript functions for Google Earth Engine are found here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To train our regression model, we read $T_{air}$ in a Pandas dataframe. To limit computation time, we train the model on a small subset of data, in this case, the Los Angeles area. The code to find weather stations in a particular area can be found here. \n",
    "\n",
    "The regression model.... [Raj/Matt fill in here]\n",
    "\n",
    "Our regression model produces coefficients $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, ...$ for a model of the form: \n",
    "$$ T_{air} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 T_{land} + \\beta_2 \\epsilon + \\beta_3 NDVI + \\beta_4 p + \\beta_5 h $$\n",
    "To produce our map of $T_{air}$, we upload these coefficients into Google Earth Engine's javascript GUI. We calculate \n",
    "\n",
    "Last, to make this data accessible to end users, we provide a function that computes the average air temperature at an area given a point. This allows users to estimate heat exposure in an area. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Future work/ to do\n",
    "- add .gitignore\n",
    "- calculate error in output\n",
    "- add atmospheric water vapor correction for LST\n",
    "- keep workflow in one location (notebook+ GEE transfer isn't automatic)\n",
